# Sudoku-Solver
Its a basic sudoku solver using backtracking method coded in Fortran 95 language. 
The idea was extended to make the sudoku into tors form and I already found a pattern where for a every number there is some situation or position the number must be repeated.
How is this useful? In my backtracking method I used to check each and every box to cross check and verify the right fit but making the sudoku into tors gives a visual clarity and also as the pattern always follows the code might had efficiency and space complexity.
